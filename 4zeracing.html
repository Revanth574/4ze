        We are a formula student electric Racing team based in SRM IST, Chennai. We make electric race
        cars for the International Formula Student/Formula SAE (Society of Automobile Engineers)
        competition held at various locations all over the world.
        The word ‘4ze’ stands for “FOR ZERO EMISSION”. 4ZE Racing is the official student formula
        electric racing team of SRM University. It is a team of 60 highly dedicated and passionate
        undergraduate student whose main passion lies in engineering and achieving new possibilities. The
        team work towards energy efficiency and aim to develop a sustainable environment. The team is
        completely managed by students, its three domains Mechanical, Electrical and Corporate work hard
        together to get it rolling on the ground and make it to the level where it can compete to the cars worldwide.
        <br>
        The spark initiated in 2012 when a group of students decided to build a car with the knowledge they
        gained from college and give the world a non-polluting vehicle. Initially, the team was small but
        their hopes were high and keeping knowledge as their base they made their first prototype car RIO.
        From then there was no looking back for the team grew larger and better with more young and
        innovative minds joining the team. They worked together day and night on their next project and
        after 3 years a new car VOLTAIC was built. The car was formula style racing car. With voltaic, team
        went to Italy in the event FSAE Italy in 2015.
        Our team was one of the five which went to Italy from India and compete against team globally at
        such a large platform. The team secured 18th position in the event.

        <h2>Protype1:RIO</h2>
       Rio was the first prototype of the team. In 2012 a group of students decided to try something new,
       something different and so they got together and started with the design of the prototype of their
       dream. After months of hard work and research they finalised the design and started giving shape to
       their dream by starting the fabrication of their prototype. After facing a lot of difficulties in some
       months the prototype was ready to roll on road. With Rio the team proved themselves and their
       worth. The prototype was a grand success. It inspired many and soon the team which was just a
       group of few students, gradually increased in number with lots of potential students joining the team

        <h2>Protype2:VOLTAIC</h2>
        With great success and response, the team once again started with the design for the next car with
        lots of innovative ideas in their mind. In 2013 the fabrication of voltaic started, once again the team
        worked day and night so that the car can roll on the road. Many difficulties were faced during the
        fabrication but the dedication of the team members concurred all of them and in 2014 the car was
        ready to roll. The first formula style electric racing was built completely by students. This was one
        proud movement for the team.

        <h2>Prototype3:ZEV2.0</h2>
        With another great success, team started with new season with new goals. The team’s major goal was
to make the car light weight at the same time decrease the overall manufacturing cost of the car.
With 6 months of designing and critical analysis the design of the new car was fixed. At the end
when the car was made completely, we not only achieved the desired goal but also other technical
advancement. A new Gear Train assembly was designed to optimize the powertrain packaging. A
new Suspension geometry was designed to improve the vehicle dynamics. With all these technical
advancements and months of hard work, ZEV 2.0 was completely fabricated in February 2017. We
participated in event FORMULA GREEN 2017 and secured 1st position.
